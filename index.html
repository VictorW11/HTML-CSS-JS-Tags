            <h3>1. Siberian</h3>
            <p4><i><b>Description:</b> Siberian cats are hypoallergenic due to their below-average enzyme levels in their saliva. Although they have a moderately long coat, many people that suffer from cat allergies don’t react or don't react as strongly to the Siberian. They are affectionate, playful and have generally good personalities overall. Siberians are talented at jumping and can problem-solve to get what they want.</i></p4>
