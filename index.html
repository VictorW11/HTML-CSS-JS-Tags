            <h3>1. Siberian</h3>
            <h4><i><b>Description:</b> Siberian cats are hypoallergenic due to their below-average enzyme levels in their saliva. Although they have a moderately long coat, many people that suffer from cat allergies donâ€™t react or don't react as strongly to the Siberian. They are affectionate, playful and have generally good personalities overall. Siberians are talented at jumping and can problem-solve to get what they want.:</i></h4>
